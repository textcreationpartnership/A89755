            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He end of every good man is Peace; and the Way of every truely-wiſe man is one and the ſame with his End. As is the End, ſuch is or ſhould be the Means thereunto. To a peaceable End, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a peaceable Way required. We all conclude in this, That unto every certain prefixed End appointed by God unto man, there is, and of neceſſity muſt be, a certain prefixed Way and Means appointed by him alſo unto that end; and that in the finding, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and continuing in the Way, we ſhall certainly and aſſuredly finde and attain the End alſo.</p>
            <p>Every man almoſt is found a ſtrong (at leaſt) preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto Peace; various and ſeveral ways, according to the various and ſeveral mindes and opinions of men, being accordingly offered and propoſed. Materials for a Building are called for, but contrary and unſutable things are brought, which ſpeaks us ſtill much <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod-</hi>like in the building of his <hi>Babel.</hi> We are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118485:3"/>
without diſpute; may it be the time of <hi>Englands</hi> coming forth. I know there is a ſet and appointed time for every purpoſe under the ſun; a time for War, as well as a time for Peace: O may it be the time of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> peace and reſt, at leaſt within it ſelf, in reference to it ſelf. I will hope, I will pray, I will beg and bow that it may. I have therefore, and unto this end, with no little diligence, made ſearch for, and enquiry after the way and means; and have thus found and concluded,</p>
            <p>That all the ſeveral Differences, Diſorders, Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Wars, and ſo conſequently the Ruines, Deaths, and Deſtructions that have ſo conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and befallen mankinde, have principally, if not onely been cauſed and occaſioned from that deſire of Soveraignty, Rule, Power, and Dominion, which ſome man or men do or would aſſume, uſurp, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe over others, whether in things Civil or Religious, as we call and (I know not why) diſtinguiſh them, or make them diſtincts or ſeverals, as if it were not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Service and Worſhip of God, to love our neighbour as our ſelf, to do good, to be juſt, righteous, pitiful, and merciful unto all men: doubtleſs it is, and it is pure and undefiled Religion too. Why the ſix laſt Commands ſhould be more diſtinct and ſeveral, and by many ſet ſo much below the four firſt, then all or any of the ten ſhould be one from another, I know not, except for number ſake onely, or ſomething there may be in order of Cauſes, (as we uſe to ſpeak) as the firſt, and ſo the four firſt, may be the ground of, leader and directer to the other: but there is not, neither can there be, any or the leaſt difference in reſpect to their eſſence and being; for the one is not, neither can it be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118485:3"/>
without the other: and therefore, as it is written, <hi>He</hi> (I am ſure) <hi>who breaks any one of them, breaks all</hi> and every one of them, ſuch is their unanimous union. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, theſe Diviſions and Undoings have and do divide and undo us all; let it be look'd to. Pardon this long Parentheſis.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon of the aforeſaid Poſition lieth ſtrong: for thereby is not onely the Law of mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture violated, his Light extinguiſhed, his Lord ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but there is there with alſo a ſeed ſown, a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid of continual Enmities, Emulations, Strifes, and Contentions; oft-times ſuch, which will not, nor which cannot ceaſe, and that unto many Generations, until it have again recovered and ſecured its own proper firſt native right, liberty, and freedom; no not, although it be with the utter overthrow, ruine, and deſtruction of him or them who have thus uſurped. Nay, to tell you the truth, as the truth is, Except a very ſtrong, even an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty interceder, interpoſer, or interpoſition be made, and come between, to reconcile and unite, there muſt be a conſtant and continual ſucceſſion of bloodſhed, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and deſtruction, even unto all eternity: and it cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe, (as I could plainly demonſtrate to you, but that I haſten) ſuch and ſo great is the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty raiſed and begotten thereby. And indeed, the thing ſhews it ſelf; it is ſo at this day, hath been ſo from the beginning of <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s ſetting up: which is ſo plain in the Scriptures, and ſo viſible through all the Nations and Kingdoms of the earth, as that indeed it needs no other proof.</p>
            <p>The Law of his Nature, I ſay, is thereby altogether violated, he having the abſolute entire Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118485:4"/>
of himſelf, in himſelf, inſeparably united to him, in his very eſſence and being: ſo that none whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, upon any pretence whatſoever, may or ought to chalenge, aſſume, or exerciſe, in any meaſure, in any kinde or ſort, any right or power with him or over him therein: for he was made perfect, and Perfection ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no more, of no ſupplement or addition; for then not perfect: but he was made up—right, in the higheſt perfection in righteouſneſs, in the image and likeneſs of God; and therefore hath God given him this Command, That he ſhould <hi>have no other gods,</hi> nor ſhould he bow down unto, ſerve, or worſhip any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him. And this is the indubitable law of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he may not relinquiſh, part with, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from; neither ſuffer himſelf, in any caſe, to be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or bereaved of, or overcome in, by any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aſſaults, or allurements whatſoever: for ſo much and ſo far as he doth, ſo far and ſo much is he ſtill in <hi>the land of Egypt,</hi> and <hi>houſe of bondage;</hi> yea, and brought under the power and dominion of darkneſs and death alſo, as <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And God never did nor doth command or forbid any thing contrary to the Laws of Nature; for that were to deny himſelf, which he can by no means do: for Natures Laws, Bounds, and Limits, are all given, ſet, ordained and appointed by himſelf, unto each and every thing, according to the nature, uſe, and end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the breach and violation whereof, is the very, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, true, and real cauſe and occaſion of all the ſeveral evils or calamities that are in the world.</p>
            <p>In a Book I lately publiſhed, which I call <hi>England's Centre and Foundation of Peace and Reſt,</hi> I there ſhew,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118485:4"/>
that Rule and Government, properly and truely, is to rule, govern, guide, and direct, the thing or things to be ruled and governed, in their certain, proper, true, juſt, and right way, unto their certain, proper, true, juſt, and right ends; and that therefore it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to him who would rule and govern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that he do certainly know the very certain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſe nature, property, and quality of the thing or things to be ruled and governed; otherwiſe, he diſturbs and diſorders them, turns away and turns aſide the thing or things from him, which he would rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern to his uſe and ſervice; and not onely ſo, but alſo makes, procures, and cauſes them to be or become his hurt, loſs, and detriment, yea his deadly (as we uſe to ſpeak) foe and enemy. To which Treatiſe, for more and more full ſatisfaction in theſe things, I refer you.</p>
            <p>This Soveraignty, Rule, Power, and Dominion, was (ſo far as we can underſtand) firſt aſſumed, uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and exerciſed by <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that <hi>mighty hunter,</hi> as the Scripture calls him; he layd the firſt foundation, and from him hath it continued ſucceſſively, more or leſs, thorowout the whole world (as may be eaſily ſeen) to this day: but it is even almoſt finiſhed, &amp; come to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate end: He would be the God and Lord in and over all; he it was that would build, form, ſhape, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion all men according to his minde and mould; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in truth, the phyſiognomies, ſhapes, and forms of men, are not more various and differing, then are their Mindes and Spirits. Wherein appears the manifold wonderful wiſdom of God; yet this wonderful varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in, by, and through the love of the ſame God, (who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118485:5"/>
is one entire perfect unity) (the which love is light, and the which light is life; for the love is the life of God, in which he onely lives, and after or in reſpect to which onely he IS, and is and can be truly ſaid to be the everliving God) are all and every variety gathered together, firmly knit and tyed up in one entire Unity; herein indeed lying, being, and conſiſting the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and beauty of the whole Creation, Unity in Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Variety againe in Unity, elſe were it a nothing but a meer heap or lump, and the bond, O the bond, the bond, the bond, which is Love.</p>
            <p>We ſee it thus in the natural body; there are ſeveral various and divers members, and divers ſeveral various works and operations, ſeverally belonging unto each and every one of them, every member being perfectly and abſolutely diſtinct in it ſelf, &amp; diſtinct in its Office, operation, imployment, and buſineſs; yet through the Love being bound up, tyed and knit together, make but one entire Body, each member ſerving other in its particular place and office in the Body, according to the Laws and Ordinances thereof; the Whole or the One being ſerved of the Whole, inſomuch that the Whole and every part is preſently ſenſible of the loſs of any the leaſt part. We ſee it alſo in thoſe things we call Contraries, as in Fire and Water, Air and Earth; which I call Severals, or Divers. We ſee all mixed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes made up thereof, and that into one moſt ſweet Harmony and perfect Unity, even of thoſe contraries ſo called. O the Love, the wonderful power, vertue, and operation thereof! though I chuſe rather to call them Severals, or Divers; for in themſelves, in their true nature, eſſenc, eand being, they will not be found ſo,

but the exceſs or the going forth or out from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in deſire and endeavour to be or have the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, hence onely grows and ariſes the difference and the enmity, as we may plainly ſee in fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the one cold and moiſt, the other hot and dry, yet each of them eagerly thirſting after, freely and fully joyning and mixing with the other, in one entire and perfect Unity: as we ſee in every perfect generation, where the deſire and intenſneſs of ſupremacy ceaſes, the onely cauſe of all the enmities in the whole Creation, and whoſe generations never were, are, or poſſibly can be perfect, but crooked, perverſe, impotent, and feeble; ſo that it is plain, that which makes the difference, and ſo cauſes and occaſions the enmity, is the exceſs or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancy.</p>
            <p>That then which muſt give, and ſo keep, maintain, continue and ſecure a true and right order, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſtrength, peace and reſt, life and ſalvation, muſt be the keeping of the Laws of God in nature, whole, entire, and inviolate; it muſt be the taking away, keeping out, and ſecuring our ſelves in the point of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Soveraignty, or rather exceſſes and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies, in that we call Rule and Government, which is, and of neceſſity muſt be, of a juſt, due, right, and true commixion, compoſure or temparament; and in truth, that is truely the onely and alone Supream and Soveraign, where, when, or in which all the Severals or Individuals do meet, unite and concenter together in one: no one or more part or parts whatſoever can in any proper and true ſence be called or ſaid to be the Soveraign or Supream; but the Soveraignty and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy lyes in the union and conjunction of all and

            <p>Gentlemen, my end and onely end is peace, ſafety, ſecurity, happineſs and reſt, life and ſalvation unto all in and of this Nation; my way alſo unto this end is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; therefore I propoſe not any new thing, nor would I that any ſhould, ſo as to bring us unto it, or that any new thing ſhould be brought unto us, which may, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtantly hath, and neceſſarily doth cauſe an occaſion many, long, great, and hot contentions, emulations, ſtrifes, hatreds, and wars, and thoſe not without the effuſion of much blood; but that each and every man of us may return into or unto our true, proper certain, and fixed Center, unto our moſt ſure, firm, and ſtable baſis and foundation, that we all be fully and wholly, perfectly, and compleatly, brought under and reſtored unto the ſubjection and protection of the ancient known fundamental laws, cuſtoms and conſtitutions of this Engliſh Nation, the laws of our fore-Fathers and thoſe onely; and that thoſe be wholly and intirely reſtored unto us, with their due, juſt, and true admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and execution; and that done and performed alſo, by ſuch men and means, in ſuch way and manner, and ſuch onely as of old, even in the beginning hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118485:6"/>
been and was uſed, accuſtomed, allowed, ordained, and appointed by our fore-Fathers; wherein and unto which onely and alone, and unto the very true obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and keeping whereof, I hold my ſelf wholly bound and obliged, and profeſs my ſelf wholly and altogether ſubject. In the Treatiſe before mentioned, I ſhewed that light is the only true and certain Ruler and Governour of all things; and that becauſe it, and it onely, carries, guides, directs, and governs all things with eaſe, peace, quiet, and ſafety, in their proper, true, juſt, and right way, unto their proper, true, juſt, and right ends; therefore, as in the great world God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things hath ordained and appointed, ſet up and made viſible, a certain, conſtant, fixed light, for the rule and governance thereof, and all things therein; ſo alſo hath he in every Microcoſme of the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature, uſe, and end each thing is by him appointed to. Were it not ſo, and ſo much, and ſo far as it is not ſo, even ſo, much, and ſo far there is, and of neceſſity muſt be confuſion, darkneſs, and death in and unto each and every created thing, as is evidently to be ſeen day by day, as when the Sun is clouded, eclipſed and goeth down, as we call it. Man, he alſo, ſo much, &amp; ſo far as he is brought forth after, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes up in and with his Image, the Image and likeneſs of God; even ſo much, and ſo far doth he make and create his things in the very ſelf-ſame Image and likeneſs; of which you ſhall finde more and more plainly in the forementioned Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>It is abſolutely neceſſary therefore, that to the right, eaſie, ſafe, quiet, peaceable, &amp; ſecure, ordering, ruling and governing of a Common or Commune weal (for ſo it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118485:7"/>
was in the beginning; it is an old word, and it is a good word) that there be a common, or commune Law (ours is ſo, and ſo called) a law equally common unto all men, or a law in which each and every one hath a like and the ſame common or commune right and propriety, and from or by which all and every one are to have a like juſtice and equity done them, without any the leaſt reſpect to any kinde, ſort, or degree of Perſons whatſoever, elſe it loſeth both its uſe, name, and end; it is the ſame for rule, government, guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the ſame for ſafety, ſecurity, and protection, and alike the ſame unto all and every one, and alike the ſame againſt all and every one, who ſhall any wiſe, by any means, in any kinde violate, infringe, and break the ſame: It is neceſſary therefore that this Law be fixed, certain, conſtant and unchangeably one and the ſame; as it is in the great light which God hath ſet in the great world, to direct, guide, and governe us in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things: otherwiſe, ſo much and ſo far as it is not ſo, ſo far and ſo much doth, and of neceſſity muſt diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, darkneſs, confuſion, and death overtake, fall and ſeiſe upon each and every one of us: and this hath been and is our caſe and condition in <hi>England</hi> at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> Law, be it known unto all the Nations, Kingdomes, and Peoples in Heaven and in Earth is this, as you ſhall finde it was in King <hi>Ethelrees</hi> Parliament enacted, <hi>That each man ſhould do as he would be done unto,</hi> which it calleth the moſt right Law; and that <hi>the higher and greater men the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents therein and breakers thereof were, by ſo much the more and heavier they ſhould be puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Law of Lawes, are our Lawes firmly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118485:7"/>
founded, both as they are in themſelves, and in their whole adminiſtration alſo (which, had I time, I could prove and particularly manifeſt) that is their only and alone Baſis and Foundation, upon which they ſtand and center in; That in all things they carry along with them, in their very eſſence and being, yea in their very face and foreheads: upon that, as upon their true hinge, they hang, winde and turn in all things, at all times, in reference unto all men. That Parliament hath it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus: that <hi>Efferatur conſilium, quod populo habeatur utiliſsimum;</hi> and again, <hi>In rem totius patriae.</hi> It would be too tedious to ſhew how often, by whom, at what time, and upon what occaſions they have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and both we and our laws invaded, treſpaſſed, and trampled upon, ever by ſuch who have gone forth from, or out of the union into exorbitancie and exceſs, breaking the limit which nature, the God of nature, and our Laws had given and ſet unto them; wherein (as is plainly to be ſeen in our Hiſtories) they have conſtanly broken, undone, ruined and deſtroyed themſelves and theirs) and at what times, by what men and means in part redeemed, reſtored, and recovered again; and therewith how much of our fore Fathers blood it hath coſt; yet never did, nor ever could any whomſoever, by all their indeavours, policies, and force they could uſe, work its extirpation in the leaſt; but the next generation of thoſe who have invaded our Land, have agreed and conſented with us in them, and ſtood with us to maintain them; yea the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders themſelves (as I ſhall ſhew anon) onely they they thought them too ſtraight and ſtrict as unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (in reference to that ſtate of Supremacy, wherein
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118485:8"/>
through the ambitiouſneſs, irregularity and exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their minde, they deſired to ſtand) have therefore cauſed and procured the making of ſome Acts, Statutes, or by-Laws, as they are called; and thoſe through the corruption of the Miniſters thereof, put in execution alſo; and ſo, a many undue, unjuſt, and irregular Proces and proceedings, judgements and executions, have been had, made, and done upon the ſame; although nothing be better and more certainly known unto the Students, Practitioners, and Miniſters of the Law, then that all Acts of Parliament whatſoever, having not their foundation plain and viſible in our common Law, are in themſelves voyd and null, and ought not, upon the higheſt penalties, be put in execution; and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it hath been ſo adjudged, that Affirmative Statutes do not annul the common Law, and that one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe againſt a Statute negative, in affirmation of the common Law, for which the comments on <hi>Littletons</hi> Burgage: Yet, I ſay, nevery did, nor never could any whomſoever extirpate the ſame; for the root thereof is too ſtrong in nature to be rooted out, vanquiſhed or deſtroyed, and ſtrongly and deeply rooted even from Heaven it ſelf in the hearts of Engliſhmen; It, that is, the true Engliſh Law, being the moſt juſt, the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, the moſt righteous, and the moſt merciful Law in the whole world, and that in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and adminiſtration thereof alſo.</p>
            <p>The Laws of <hi>England,</hi> or the Engliſhmens Laws, even the Laws of our fore-fathers, of whom <hi>Nennius</hi> confeſſeth that the Britiſh Annales had the deſcent of their <hi>Brute</hi> or <hi>Britto</hi> from <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you have ſeen how that God hath in all things given unto man, in the very law of his nature, eſſence, and being, the whole and ſole power, rule, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and government, of and over himſelf, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, entirely, in and unto himſelf; ſo that he hath and is, and of neceſſity muſt have and be, according to the Law of his Creation, King, Prieſt, and Prophet, in and of himſelf, in reference to himſelf; which (as is ſaid before) none may aſſume, uſurp, or-exerciſe over him, nor may he ſuffer it from, nor give it up unto any other whomſoever, upon the greateſt, heavieſt, and ſoreſt puniſhments that can be inflicted. Hence it is the Laws of our forefathers, and now our Laws by and through
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118485:9"/>
them, have ſo wonderfully, carefully, exactly, and ſtrongly provided and fortified us in this caſe, that it ſeems and appears to be their utmoſt and onely end, to keep, protect, ſecure, and maintain each and every one herein, from all and every one that ſhould offer or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any breach or violation thereof, by aſſuming, uſurping, and exerciſing any power, right, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereunto, and ſo break and violate the Law of mans nature, and therein become a moſt grievous and great tranſgreſſor both againſt God and Man. Hence it makes every mans houſe his Caſtle, which may not by any man be entered without his conſent, except in one caſe, and that extraordinary, and that alſo in a known, open, and legal way, after entrance damanded, and the parties refuſal. Yet deny they not, in any caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, any man or men whomſoever, to take, receive, uſe, and enjoy the help, aid, or aſſiſtance of any man or men whomſoever himſelf judgeth neceſſary, fit, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient thereunto; provided that he injure, moleſt, or trouble not his neighbour, but that he in all things do as he would be done unto, according to the Law; and that he do not that unto another, which he would not that another ſhould do unto him: which if he break, and complaint thereof be made, then or in ſuch caſe onely doth or can the Law take cognizance; the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, tryal, and judgement, (in caſe he be found guilty) being altogether by his Neighbours, and thoſe of his own chuſing. For every Officer and Miniſter of Juſtice whom or whatſoever, by the Laws of this Nation are to be freely choſen by the Neighbourhood where they are to officiate and adminiſter. It tyeth no man to complain, loth to finde any offender; very piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118485:9"/>
and merciful to offenders, as is to be ſeen in caſes of life and death: none may be judges therein, who are exerciſed in any meaſure in the ſhedding of blood; as Souldiers, Chirurgeons, Butchers, and the like. And if he have none ſuch impanelled for his Jury, yet may he (if he ſee cauſe) except againſt any other whom he may judge not his very, true, and real friends, to the number of Five and thirty. And indeed, there will be found little or no uſe or need at all for any Laws, but to keep, preſerve, ſecure, and protect Mankinde herein, and from the violence and oppreſſion thereof, or of ſuch men: therefore were they in the beginning but few, very few, and thoſe but ſhort, very ſhort. The care, wiſdom, and providence of our forefathers lay as much (that I ſay not more) in ſecuring the way and manner of attaching, trying, judging, and executing thoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from injury, injuſtice, violence, and oppreſſion, in the ſeveral proces and proceedings they are to make therein, as it did to ſecure the end: and there is or ſhould be in all things as much fear of loſing, and as much care of keeping the true, right, and juſt Way, as of the End; for the Way ſecures the End; the keeping whereof, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the End; the loſing whereof, loſes (or at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely endangers) the End. And the party accuſed (if found an offender) may ſuffer manifold much more in the way of his Attaching, Trying, Judging, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting, then in the Judgement and Execution it ſelf: and thereby is the Law extremely violated, and much injuſtice done.</p>
            <p>It is noted by <hi>Bede,</hi> who (obſerving how Religion was preached both to King and Counts, <hi>omnibus Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus)</hi> ſaith, that <hi>there was a licenſe granted for publike
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118485:10"/>
Preaching: but when the King and divers great men were converted and baptized, yet there was no force uſed to compel others to be of that Religion, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were taught that Chriſts ſervice muſt be voluntary, and not forced.</hi> And verily, God himſelf, who is the Creator, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Ruler of all things, yet forceth he not, nor compelleth he any thing, no not unto the beſt good, beyond its preſent light, power, and ſtrength: for ſo much and ſo far as any doth, even ſo much and ſo far doth he very extremely wrong, injure, and oppreſs the ſame. As, ſuppoſe I finde a Lamb ſtrayed from its paſture, weak, and almoſt ſtarved for the want of it; I pity it, and would preſerve it: but ſhould I now hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and drive this Lamb beyond its ſtrength, I might deſtroy it before it come there. Or, ſuppoſe a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted man were to paſs a deep water, over or by mean of an extreme narrow bridge; if I ſhould now hurry and force him along, and not give him time and leaſure to finde the bridge, or when he is upon it, compel him faſter then his ſight and feet can finde the foundation, I might endanger his drowning. We may our ſelves, and alſo cauſe others to make ſuch haſte, as that we may endanger not onely the loſs of our Way, but our End alſo: or, if we do attain our End, our haſte may make us altogether unable to reſt there. Much leſs doth he force or compel any thing contrary unto, above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or beſides the law of its Nature; nor requires he (of any) more then he hath given, or in any other way, or unto any other end then he hath appointed; and hath made man himſelf judge thereof. And verily had not God given and ſet up in and unto man, a Law in and unto himſelf, he could not charge, accuſe, judge,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118485:10"/>
or condemn man; for, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſsdon:</hi> and the Law written in Tables, is no more nor no other then the Law of God in Nature, by him ſet, given, and appointed in its Creation: for God changeth not, but is immutable in all his ways and works; but man he changeth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth, and falleth in himſelf from himſelf, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth out of himſelf, unto other Gods, bowing, falling down unto, fearing, ſerving, and worſhipping them: whereas man, as he was made, ſo ſhould he ſtand, remain, and continue perfectly upright, in and unto himſelf. Wherefore it is written, that <hi>the Gentiles who have not the Law, yet do by nature the things contained in the Law, they having not the</hi> written <hi>Law</hi> (in Tables of ſtone) <hi>are a law unto themſelves, which ſhew the effects of the Law written in their hearts,</hi> (or, that the Law hath its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ground in nature, as the efficient cauſe thereof) <hi>their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or excuſing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion, or the true and real Service and Worſhip of God, lies not in Forms, but in Eſſentialities: yet I ſay not that true Forms are to be deſpiſed or forſaken; for nothing is without its true form.</p>
            <p>Verily, I was never ſo much afraid of any ſort of men, as thoſe who come ſo much clothed with the name of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> and I profeſs before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, they are generally the moſt dangerous and deceitful men in the whole world, and were ſo from the beginning. O theſe zealous men undo us all! Look into the Old Teſtament, there you ſhall finde ſtill how theſe <hi>men of God,</hi> as they are called, have ſtill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the people to erre. <hi>Aaron,</hi> their firſt High-prieſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118485:11"/>
no ſooner was <hi>Moſes</hi> abſent, but he makes them a molten calf. The Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets, all along, are the men chiefly complained of by the Lord, who led and drew away the hearts of the people from the Lord.</p>
            <p>You ſhall finde the ſame in the New Teſtament, and all along ſince to this day, (but theſe here in our days excel herein all that ever went before them; you ſhall have nothing almoſt in their mouthes but God, and all for God, and the <hi>Godly Party;</hi> when, as the Lord lives, they know little or nothing of him. I tell you, God is certainly a moſt ſtable, fixed, juſt, righteous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, upright, and faithful being; yea, and he is moſt merciful alſo: all which you might eaſily ſee, and that every day, but that you do and will ſhut your eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sun, <hi>which ſhines upon the good and upon the bad)</hi> nor indeed can it (very hardly, I might ſay, poſſibly, and prove it too, but that I haſten) be otherwiſe, whilſt Kings and Prieſts claim a right, power, priviledge, and prerogative from God thereunto, diſtinct from, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other men, as being better, more excellent, or more holy then they. Wherefore it was not without good ground, that the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (even of <hi>Judah,</hi> who, of all that ever I heard or read of, might claim to be immediately from God, and ſo plead exemption from Man's either Judgement or Choice; yet they, even thoſe of the houſe of <hi>David</hi> in ſpecial) were to be judged, as well as to judge; which is clear (as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cited a little after hath it) in their <hi>Sanhedrin, Melec,</hi> and other parts of their Talmud; and that not onely before they were crowned, for the Crown was not ſo intayled on the next heir male, or others of that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that their great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was always to judge
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118485:11"/>
and determine whether any ſuch Heir was fit for the Crown, both in regard of his Knowledge, and of his Vertue. And after Coronation alſo, the King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> was by their Law to be judged, and to ſubmit to Corporal puniſhment, by ſtripes, or ſome other way; I, and that for ſuch things, as to ſome may ſeem but ſmall defaults, as, for <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of wives, horſes, or chariots,</hi> and for <hi>uſing or abuſing money beyond the mean and rule preſcribed by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews High-prieſt, a very ſacred perſon, and the Lords Anointed alſo; but yet ſuch as muſt ſtill ſubmit to the Sentence of the great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> nay, and that for his life alſo, if they ſo adjudged him; for which, and for that ſaid before of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>'s power over the Jewiſh King in Criminals, and in War, I might cite divers clear paſſages from the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and thoſe that expound it, long before <hi>Cochius</hi> on <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or <hi>Schic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard's Jus Regium.</hi> Thus ſayth my Author. And perhaps that Commonwealth had continued longer, and much better, in more glory, a more ſtable and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led condition, had this their Diſcipline been fully and conſtantly maintained, faithfully, duely, and truely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: for, as is ſaid before, you ſhall always finde their Kings and Prieſts leading the people into errours, and all prophaneſs and wickedneſs. The ground of their deſire to have a King, being, as the Scripture tells us, that they might have <hi>one to go in and out before them, to fight their battels;</hi> a Captain-General, plain and clear, and no other; whom they would have a conſtant, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, fixed Officer; whenas God would onely, as juſt occaſion ſhould be given or offered, then onely ſhould be one choſen and appointed, as it was here amongſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118485:12"/>
the ancient Brittons in the beginning. But, ſay the people of <hi>Iſrael, Let us have a King, like all the nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us:</hi> and they were their Leaders and Conductors in their Wars. But yet they are and muſt be thus bound and limited, as you ſee; and nothing better for them, and for the Commonwealth, then that it ſhould ſo be, for that nothing is more apt to exceed its bounds, then is <hi>Mars</hi> and Martial men: fire (of which Martial men participate much) is a very great Tyrant, except very well tempered, ordered, allayed, or qualified; it ceaſes not until it have eaten up and devoured all that ſtands before it; nor makes it, neither can it make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: yet, in its due place, to its right uſe and end, is (as all other things are) excellent good.</p>
            <p>We have it promiſed us by the Lord, that <hi>there ſhall be no more need of teaching one another, but that all ſhall be taught of him;</hi> and <hi>the knowledge of him ſhall cover the earth, as the waters do the ſea.</hi> And verily, my ſoul earneſtly prays, bows, and begs for this thing: ſo ſhall reſt and peace be unto the inhabitants of the earth, and great will be the joy thereof.</p>
            <p>O that man did but know, and would but be himſelf, he would not then give his glory, his honor, &amp; his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unto any King, or Prieſt, any man or men whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>England</hi> hath not yet done it, hath not yet given its glory, honor and dignity unto any whomſoever; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome private and particular men may have done, it hath not bowed down its head, to cauſe it to ſerve other Gods, as the Iſraelites did, of whom God ſaith as it is written, that <hi>they made him to ſerve continually unto their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi> (&amp; <hi>the head of every man,</hi> as it is written, <hi>is God)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God ſcattered them upon the face of the earth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118485:12"/>
made them to be ſervants, and to ſerve in and unto all Nations: yet doth the time of their reſtitution draw near. Which that <hi>England</hi> hath not yet done, I ſhall, by the Laws, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions thereof, briefly and but in part ſhew you by and by, and give you ſome of thoſe many demonſtrations and teſtimonies thereof, and of our conſtant, firm, and inviolate keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, maintaining, upholding, and defending our ſelves in our native liberties and freedomes, in our priſtine, firſt, primitive, original honor, glory, and dignity: for this, the defence and maintenance of our ſelves and ours herein, for theſe many years by-paſt, have we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and conteſted, againſt Kings, Prieſts, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; and for this thing, even at this day, do we yet conteſt againſt all whomſoever, and whatſoever ſhall infringe the ſame.</p>
            <p>O Noble, Renowned, Glorified, and much Dignified Engliſhmen, whoſe perfect reſurrection is at hand, and whoſe glory and renown ſhall fill and overſpread all Lands, becauſe of this thing, even in <hi>England</hi> ſhall ariſe the glory, and the <hi>deſire of all Nations. I have ſaid it, and it ſhall ſurely come to paſs;</hi> Look therefore unto your ſelves, every man of you, and <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberties wherewith God,</hi> and Nature, and the Laws of this Land, <hi>have made you free;</hi> nor ſtoop, nor bow, nor bend one jot unto any man or men whomſoever, but as unto bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but worſhip the Lord thy God only: <hi>honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> and <hi>love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Take heed of <hi>Dalilabs;</hi> for though thou be a <hi>Samſon,</hi> yet if thou ſuffereſt thy ſeven locks to be ſhaved off, the <hi>phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> will take thee, yea and <hi>put out both thine eyes</hi> alſo, <hi>binde thee in fetters,</hi> and <hi>cauſe thee to grinde in thepriſon-houſe.</hi>

The wiſe will know this ſaying, and underſtand this Parable. I make haſte. If we bow and ſtoop, we will bow and ſtoop unto the weak and feeble, the poor and needy: we may not, we muſt not, we cannot, we will not give our glory, our honor, our dignity and our ſtrength unto any, left we be bound in fetters, and grinde in the priſon-houſe: and we love our eyes too well, to loſe them.</p>
            <p>Verily we have our Fore-fathers with us, and on our ſide, in this matter; we have <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, David, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> even all who are not of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> race and generation, are now riſen and ariſing up againſt <hi>Nimrod,</hi> whoſe Kingdome hangs tottering and ſhaking, being even ready to fall: we have <hi>Iſrael, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom there is no divination or Inchantment,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> on our ſide, who is <hi>the God of Gods, Lord of Lords, and King of Kings:</hi> we therefore ſhall certainly overcome and prevail; none ſhall or can ſtand before us. God hath <hi>overurned,</hi> and will yet overturn even ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, until none of <hi>Nimrods</hi> do appear.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen that it is againſt the command and law of God, againſt the command and law of Nature, and againſt the law of the land, even the law &amp; command of our Fore-fathers, made, given, and continued, by, from, and through them and their blood, unto us their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as is at this day: Look to it therefore, again, I ſay, every man of you; for he who breaks and violates the ſame, is a traitor unto God, unto nature, unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, unto his fore-Fathers, and unto the laws of this Land and Nation, and hath no right or intereſt, no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inheritance in the ſame, but ought according to the laws thereof, to be wholly diſ-franchiſed, diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned,

            <p>In the Laws of St. <hi>Edward</hi> and king <hi>William,</hi> you may find and read in the very Title and Preface there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that all the Laws of king <hi>Edward,</hi> came to us through the hands of king <hi>William,</hi> which you will find related and recorded in the Title and Preface thereof: That all thoſe Laws were ſo preſented to king <hi>William,</hi> by a ſworn Jury out of every County; who did alſo aſſert, that thoſe which they did preſent as the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> were the undoubted Laws and Cuſtoms of the kingdome, that had alſo been collected into a body by king <hi>Edgar;</hi> and continued (though <hi>Sopitae)</hi> through the troubles of ſucceeding kings till <hi>Edward</hi> had the leaſure to renew or rather confirm what was the Law before.</p>

            <p>In the ſtatutes of <hi>Marlebridg</hi> in the firſt place of all, it was agreed and enacted, that all men living of this kingdome, as well high as low muſt and ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to judgemens; the ſame <hi>Marlbridg</hi> in one of his other Chapters ſaith, That the great Charter is in all points to be duly kept, as well in thoſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the king, as any other; and that writs ſhould be granted freely againſt any that infringe the ſame.

And the Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror written for the moſt part before the conqueſt (as it is called) tells us from the Saxon Parliaments, that the kings Courts ſhould be open unto all plaints, by which they had original writs without delay, as well againſt the king or Queen, as any other of the people, <hi>Cap. 1.

we are not a little beholding for his great pains in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, evincing, and vindicating the Engliſh liberties, founded in, defended and maintained by the ancient Laws, cuſtoms and conſtitutions of this Nation; I may not name him, becauſe himſelf, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, hath denied it to us: his book beareth Title thus:</p>

            <p>You will finde throughout the ſame, that Kings were elective, and elected by the kingdome, or people, and the law, or at leaſt the cuſtome for electing, anointing judging and executing, Kings among our Britiſh Anceſtors, and ſince all along, how they were in all things ſubject to the law equally with the others of the people, as is already ſhewed: how when we had kings, how ſtraightly and ſtrictly they were bound and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (for, as I think I ſhewed before, there was a time when we had no king.)</p>
            <p>In his 81. p. he there ſhews, that the Lord Chief Juſtices, the Lord Chancellor and Treaſurer, were choſen by the kingdome, and not by the king.</p>

               </hi> ſpeaking of the ancient <hi>Brittons,</hi> (as he hath it in another place) ſaith, that they choſe their Generals and all great Officers &amp; Magiſtrates: and that they abhorred for a long time the name of a king: and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that we had no kings or fixed common Governour in times of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118485:16"/>
peace, but for war they choſe out Generals; yea, and that the Lords in Parliament were choſen by the Counties, as appears by writs yet to be read from the Rolls of <hi>Edward</hi> 1. and how that by the common law and cuſtome of this Nation, all the Sheriffs do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>poſſe Regni</hi> in their ſeverall Counties; and that not only in execution of writs, but they are alſo <hi>cuſtos Legis &amp; Reipublica;</hi> the keepers, protectors, and defenders of the Laws and the Reipublike or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (its all one) as well as of the peace, of which he is the principal conſervator in his ſhire and County, and that all the Sheriffs ought to be, and ſo were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the people, and not by the king, as is to be found in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> in the Laws of the Confeſſor: and in full Parliament of <hi>Edward</hi> 1. it was declared to be the law and cuſtome of the kingdome, and therefore ſo ſetled in the choice of the people. And although in latter times ſome alteration be made herein by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet this affirmative Statute doth not annul the common law, or diſannul the peoples choice, had they the wit or courage to elect their Sheriffs before they be pricked; And that theſe ſo choſen by the people, did come to Parliament. Their Generals alſo, when occaſion was, were choſen by the people, as he hath it in another place: the ſole and whole choice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, Headboroughs (greater men then themſelves know themſelves to be) Coroners, and others, remain ſtill in the people.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that our Anceſtors did both elect and bound their kings and Generalls, <hi>Rex ex Nobilitate, Duces ex vertute ſumunt:</hi> and of their kings (he ſaith) their power was ſo bounded, that he could not call it

            <p>In the great Moot of <hi>Scotlands</hi> dependency upon <hi>England, Edward</hi> 1. confeſſed, and after him the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament both Lords and Commons, that they were all obliged by oath to maintain the rights, liberties, laws and cuſtomes of the kingdom, and they never would, nor could conſent that the king ſhould, if he would, act againſt them. The Writs alſo, in king <hi>Iohns</hi> time, required all men of all conditions to oblige themſelves by oath to maintaine the great Charter, and to compell the king thereunto; which laws of king <hi>William,</hi> with thoſe of the Confeſſor, were afterwards confirmed by king <hi>Henry</hi> 1. as appears by his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only in the Exchequer, a copy of which was kept in every County; and the ſame Charter was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain confirmed by king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and again by <hi>Henry</hi> 3. and ſo it came into the great Charter, and confirmed in more then 30. Parliaments.</p>
            <p>You now ſee it plaine, and without diſpute, that no man or men whomſoever, have any rule, power, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over others, no more then others have over him or them; and that the greateſt, even Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have acknowledged, confeſſed, and granted ſo much, that we are all equally alike ſubject to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, cuſtomes, and conſtitutions of our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the laws of this Nation; and that they, and they only, are the only and alone Rulers, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours over and unto all, and every one of us.</p>
            <p>And verily, if any man or men whomſoever, may in any true and proper ſence be ſaid to be ſubject to, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power, dominion, rule and government of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118485:17"/>
it is certainely thoſe we call our Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, they being choſen, ordained appointed and intruſted by the people, unto their work and ſervice, for to perform, do, and execute their commands, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and appointments, ſtill in and according unto Law: (And verily none elſe whomſoever may or ought, without greatly tranſgreſſing the Laws of God, the Law of mans nature, and the Law of this Land, as is fully proved already.) Hence they are rightly called Officers and Miniſters of the Commonwealth; Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Miniſters of ſuch and ſuch a Place, Office, Court, or People, in reference to ſuch and ſuch a work, buſineſs, and imployment therein, or thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: receiving a wages, ſtipend, or ſalary for the ſame, are therefore ſeverally moſt certainly accountable for their ſeveral truſts, unto thoſe from whom they ſeverally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame: Firſt, by their undertaking that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Place, or Miniſtration; in which very act, they have made, created, or begotten a contract and truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves (for no man takes and executes an Office, but it muſt be from, and ſo in reference unto another) according unto which contract, they do therein and thereby firmly binde and oblige themſelves unto a true, real, and faithful performance thereof (of which you may ſee more in my forementioned Treatiſe.) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In that alſo they receive a wages, ſtipend, or ſalary for the ſame, as the moſt, if not all of them do; upon this ground and foundation it ſtands, upon this account, or for this cauſe and reaſon it is, that all our Kings we accountable, and did ſeveral of them account unto the people, and ſuffered alſo for the breach of their truſt, for their irregular, unlawful, and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118485:17"/>
execution of their place, office, &amp; truſt, thereby breaking and violating the ſame, and their Oath alſo taken in their admittance thereinto: which every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſter or Officer likewiſe taketh, before his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into any office of truſt whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Every King of <hi>England</hi> had a Wages, Stipend or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary allowed him by the People, ſome more and ſome leſs, ſome more at ſome time then at another, at the diſcretion of the People: this was one ground alſo, why the Captains of war or Generals were choſen by the people, be cauſe they received their Wages, Stipends or Salaries from the people, and their truſt and comiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo, for which alſo, and according unto which, they were accountable, and did account likewiſe: ſo alſo the knights of Shires choſen, intruſted and deputed by the people, and in their behalf, as in their ſteads, and for their ſervice to ſit in Parliament, received Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the ſeverall Shires, for which they ſerved; ſo that ſervants they are alſo unto thoſe who chuſe them.</p>
            <p>And the matter is moſt plain and evident in kings, who did ever firſt ſwear fealty to the Commonwealth and laws, as their ſuperiours or leige-Lord, before the people ſwore faith to them.</p>
            <p>Therefore would not our fore-Fathers, as you ſee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or give the choice of any publicke officer or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whatſoever into the hands or power of their king, when they had a king, nor ſuffer him to chuſe any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould not be as ſervants unto him, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being but a ſervant unto them, leſt by their chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of one another, they ſhould become, of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to be their Lords and Maſters, as in truth it came to paſs. Hence was it, as you have ſeen that the Lords in Parliament or Barons were choſen by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118485:18"/>
People, and not choſen or ſummoned by the King; for their creation or being was anciently, and at the firſt, from and by the people only, and not by the king, by Patent or Creation, by choice or election from or by him, but by the election and choice of the people one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but when once the people had ſuffered this incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their kings, through diſobedience to, revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and backſliding from the laws, ordinances, cuſtoms and conſtitutions of their Fathers, they quickly ſaw and felt the miſeries, inconveniencies, and miſchiefs, which followed thereupon: how thoſe whom they had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appointed their ſervants, by their electing and chuſing one another; of ſervants, became, in very deed and truth, their grievous, oppreſſing, and tyrannizing Lords and Maſters: and how much blood and treaſure hath it coſt us ſince, to redeem our ſelves! Take heed of a relapſe. And verily it is almoſt impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe, (as I could plainly evidence, but I muſt haſten.) Certainly he who chuſes, makes, and creates, cannot but have a very great influence upon the party choſen, made, and created: and the perſon ſo made, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and choſen, cannot but look up unto, have an eye upon, and eſpecial reſpect and regard of, bend and bow unto him that made and created, choſe or elected him: it is his duty; they are in their very nature, eſſence, and being, relatives; and relatives muſt needs reciprocally anſwer each other in their ways and ends. Hence the Commons onely choſe all their publike Miniſters and Officers; from them onely did they receive their truſt, that ſo their eyes might be onely upon them, and they onely ſerve the common good. But thoſe who lately were, now are not; but both they and theirs turned out of doors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:118485:18"/>
Our fore-fathers verily were very wiſe, prudent, and provident; O that we would tread in their ſteps, and ſo honour them, cleave to their Laws and Ordinances. I beg every man to take heed: God is my witneſs, I am enemy to no man or men whomſoever; nor do I envie any, but would from my ſoul, the good, the peace, and welfare of all and every one; and will lye at the feet of all or any one, to do him real, upright, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice: it becometh man to be faithful; for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe pattern and image he is made, is ſo. I may not, I muſt not diſhonour my Maker; but in all things, in all times, unto all men, ſo much and ſo far as I am able, ſhew forth his being as he is in me, and my being as I am in him.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you know from and by whom you are, what you are; you know what power and authority you have, and by whom and what Commiſſion it is; and ſo, whoſe you are, and to whom accountable: your hand may finde out (ſo far as I know, and I believe it may) a work ſutable to you, and correſponding with you. That which hath erected it ſelf without Law, may (for ought I know) be ſo taken away, and thrown or caſt down, though perhaps it were much better if it could be otherwiſe; for the ſooner things return and run in their right chanel, the ſweeter, eaſier, ſafer, more acceptable, ſurer and quieter it will be: but that which ſtands in &amp; by Law, may no man take away, change, or alter. If you keep your limit, you may be ſafe; if you break it, you break your ſelves. Break not, I beſeech you, in any caſe, the Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of our forefathers, the ancient Laws of this Nation; for if you do, they will aſſuredly break you.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118485:19"/>
Intrench not upon them; for wherein, ſo much, and ſo far as you do, you do certainly intrench upon your neereſt ſelves. Excuſe and pardon this long Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
            <p>As all the Publike Miniſters and Officers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth are accountable, yet are they no otherwiſe accountable, then as it is in and by the Law ordained and appointed to them. For it were as great an evil, miſchief, injuſtice, and unrighteouſneſs, that they ſhould be left to the Arbitrary will of the people, as that any of the people ſhould be left to their Arbitrary will. So that every one, before he enters upon his Truſt, ſees what his Work and Truſt is, from whom he receives it; how, or after what manner; in what way, and by what means to execute; to what end, and for what uſe and uſes; and in what way and manner to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unto whom. Otherwiſe the Publike Miniſters and Officers of the Commonwealth were in a far worſe condition then the worſt of Slaves. Accountable (without diſpute) they are and muſt be, and ſervants (without diſpute) alſo: for to him who appoints me my work, and pays me my wages; him who makes me all and whatever I am or poſſibly can be, in reference to that Office, Place, or Employment, Certainly his I am, and no mans elſe I may, muſt, or ought to be, no not mine own, but his entire, upright, true, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant, as faithful unto him or them with whom I have thus contracted, receive my work and wages, as he can be to himſelf, ſtill in reference to my Contract; for which, ſee my fore-mentioned Treatiſe. Yet in all this is there no diſhonour unto any man, but much honour unto him who is upright and faithful in his Truſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

to thoſe, and for their ſingular good and profit, who intruſted him.</p>
            <p>The Father, and he only, is appointed by God unto his Children, their ruler, guide, and governour, their guardian, their preſerver and protector whilſt Children; therefore are the Children commanded by God to honor him. All the reſt of mankind are our brethren, our neighbours; and accordingly by the ſame command of God, are we to love them as our ſelves: all other degrees, ranks, qualities, eſtates and conditions of men whatſoever (call them as you pleaſe) are onely by, of, and from men, and ſo in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</p>
            <p>As in the creations of God all things are, and only ſo are, and ſo onely by us to be eſteemed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, according to what he by his Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes in Nature hath put in them and upon them, in reference to their ſeveral uſes and ends whereunto he hath appointed them; by the true and certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, we are taught and inſtructed to give each and every thing its due and true eſtimate, neither under nor over valuing any thing, for the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is equally evil, and the onely, true, and very cauſe of all the diſcords, diſagreements, and diſſentions, in the whole Creation of God: Even ſo in the Creations of men likewiſe, all things are, and ſo onely are, and ſo onely by us to be eſteemed and accounted of, according to what in and by the Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of our Fore-fathers, the Laws of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are put in them and upon them, in reference unto the ſeveral uſes and ends whereunto they have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; by the true and certain knowledge whereof,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118485:20"/>
we are taught and inſtructed to give unto each and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular perſon and thing their due and true worth and eſtimate, ſo as neither to under nor over-value them or any of them; both the one and the other being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually evil here alſo, and the onely, true, and very cauſe of all the diſcords, diſagreements, and diſſentions amongſt us. Nor can it be otherwiſe, neither can there poſſibly be a true concord, perfect union, ſetled and eſtabliſhed peace and reſt unto us, or any of us whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, whoſe beings and well-beings have reference to the being and well-being of this Nation, until each and every man whomſoever in particular, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general, know what he is; know how, as by what means, or upon what grounds, and to what uſe and uſes, end and ends, he is that which he is, or taketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be. (For Man is a ſeeing, knowing, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature, therefore cannot walk by uncertain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Rules and Laws; he may not yeeld a blinde implicite obedience, for he knows not whither it will lead and carry him; nor is ſuch an obedience acceptable with God or good men: in children, whilſt children, it is good and comely. <hi>Paul, whilſt he was a childe</hi> (as he ſaith of himſelf) <hi>walked as a childe; but when he came to be a man, he put away childiſhneſs.</hi> Andverily, he who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and ſubjects himſelf, upon this account, unto any one man, will (at leaſt in probability) ſubmit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelf unto all &amp; every one; and ſo having no ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in himſelf, becomes a ſervant (or a ſlave rather) unto the wills, luſts, and pleaſures of all or any man whomſoever; then which, nothing is more uncomely, or unbeſeeming Man. <hi>O Man, where art thou? hideſt thou thy ſelf from, canſt thou not ſtand in, the preſence of the

Lord thy Maker? Haſt thou eaten? hath the Serpent through the woman beguiled thee? Why; ariſe again, and come and ſtand forth, in the might, power, and ſtrength of the Lord God thy Maker and Redeemer.</hi> It is a Parentheſis; bear with it.)</p>
            <p>I ſay it cannot be, until each and every member thereof know, be ſet and placed in, faſt bound, tied, and limited to, and that in a true, right, and proper way, by a true, right, and proper means, in their true, right, and proper place, in the body or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in reference unto the ſeverall uſes it hath of them, and the ſeverall ends ordained and appointed to them, according to the ancient Ordinances, Cuſtomes, and Conſtitutions of our Fore-fathers the laws of this Nation. Hence, becauſe men know not theſe things, are the many and ſeveral thwartings, contradictions, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayings and oppoſitions amongſt us; former and late acts done and committed in Parliament, thwarting, contradicting, nay deſtroying, the Peoples, nay even their own foundation and being.</p>
            <p>Officers and Miniſters of the Common-wealth, not knowing where they be, how or what they are, nor what they do, but each almoſt thwarting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting other; and they all, almoſt as Lords and maſters over the people, thwart, contradict, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the people in their liberties: the people they alſo thwarting, contradicting, ready to riſe up againſt them, well knowing them to be but their ſervants, their Officers and Miniſters, in, by, and under the law, and ſo bound neither to do nor execute any of the orders or commands of any, againſt or beſides the ſame, the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent known laws of the Land, which they as Officers are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118485:21"/>
more eſpecially and particularly bound by oath unto the exact and true obſervance, and execution of thoſe, and choſe only, and thoſe in all things, in all times, in reference unto all men; they being their onely and alone rule and guide; and ſo, therein and thereby, are they bound and obliged to keep &amp; preſerve the peace of the Commonwealth from being violated by any; or the common or commune peace, or the peace of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, inviolate: which cannot be done but by keeping its laws, the common or commune laws, inviolate; for every breach and violation of its laws, is and needs muſt be a breach and violation of its peace; and there is not, neither can there be any violation or breach of its peace, but in or by the breach and violation of its laws. As it is in the naturall body, ſo it is here alſo; ſo long as there is no breach or violation made upon the laws of Nature in the body, there is not not can there be any breach in the peace of the body: but when once there is a breach and violation made upon the laws thereof, there is then alſo, and needs muſt be, a violation and breach of the peace thereof; for they are ſuch or ſo an one or union, as that the one inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably is in, with, and by, the other; nay, the one is the other; and the one is not, nor poſſibly can be without the other. Yea all and every one of us are bound and tied not only to keep, preſerve, ſecure and maintain the peace in our own perſons in reference to our ſelves, but alſo the joint common or commune peace of the whole, in reſpect to all and every one, againſt all and every one, who ſhall evidently and clearly break, or attempt to break the ſame; for ſo doth each and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler member of the naturall body, (being tied and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118485:21"/>
bound thereunto by the law of its Nature) carefully and diligently to look to the preſervation, as of the whole, ſo of each particular, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof in reference to the whole; the loſs or detriment of any part, being a loſs and detriment to the whole and every part; Yet ſtill in a due way and courſe of law. Wherefore all and every violent act and acts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extent, meaſure, and degree thereof, by any done and executed contrary to, againſt, beſides or without a true ground and warrant in law, upon any particular perſon or perſons, is rightly and truely called and determined in our law to be a breach of the publick, common, or commune peace, becauſe it is a breach of the common or commune law, that law which is in common to them all, to keep them all and every one in perfect peace and ſecurity, from and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the force and violence of all and every one. Hence, in caſe I meet a man that hath murdered my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Friend, or Brother; yet may I not my ſelf, or any others, lay violent hands on him: ſhould I, and ſo wilfully take away his life, I make my ſelf a murtherer, and muſt and ought to dy for it: why? not becauſe the man ought not to have ſuffered death, but becauſe I had no power, authority, or right by law to do it; my act therein being contrary to, againſt, and beſides the Law, I become a breaker of the Law, and a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, in taking away his life without due courſe of law, and ſo muſt and truly ought to ſuffer death by the law. And ſo againe, if any man ſtrike me, I may not ſtrike him again; for that is a breach of the peace, becauſe it is a breach of the Law, which allows no man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge or revenge himſelf, or to extort ſatisfaction from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118485:22"/>
any, in any violent forceable way and manner; which all and every act &amp; acts are, and ſo accounted and adjudged by our law, which are not done and executed in the way and manner the Law hath ordained and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet, bindeth it no man from defending himſelf; yet there alſo, for any act or acts committed therein, by any in ſo defending himſelf, he is not free until in a due courſe of law, the law hath made him free. Our Fore-fathers were very ſtrict and exact as to the way in all things, wherein appeared their admirable, great, and exceeding high and deep wiſdome, very much to be admired, and moſt worthily to be eſteemed and honour'd of us all, wonderfully careful to ſet, keep, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and maintain every thing in its right place, in its due order, unto its proper uſe and end, truely and juſtly balancing all things, giving every thing its true weight and meaſure, bounding and limiting the ſame; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way and means to preſerve, keep, maintain, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace, reſt, quietneſs, and tranquillity. As in the natural body, when any thing is out of joynt, out of its right and proper place, and when and where there is exorbitances, and exceſſes, there is and needs muſt be reſtleſneſs, diſquiet, pain, and trouble in and unto the whole, and each and every particular part thereof in its meaſure; and if not timely reſtored and reduced, will and of neceſſity muſt bring a total ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the whole, and each and every particular part thereof; and as it is in the natural, ſo muſt and will it be in the civil; for they anſwer each other, as in a glaſs face anſwereth face.</p>
            <p>What I formerly aſſerted in my late Treatiſe before ſpoken of, that Parliaments might not change or alter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118485:22"/>
the Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Conſtitutions of our fore-fathers, the ancient Fundamental Laws of this Nation, nor do any thing tending thereunto, Is now (I hope) plain and evident unto all, and undeniable by any. And although what I therein layd down, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate men was enough; yet being already, as to this Diſcourſe, become ſo much a fool for the ſake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I ſhall make a little further progreſs, and give you theſe following Arguments; and by the way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (from the fifth Command, and the caſe of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi> by me therein cited) how far or how much the commands of fathers binde and oblige their children: it may (compared with that ſtory) deſerve a ſerious conſideration.

Otherwiſe he ceaſes to be a man, to yeeld obedience as a man ſhould, or as becomes a man to do, but as a beaſt. 2.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118485:24"/>
of the people, and commend the Bereans with the ſtile and title of Nobility for ſo doing: (yet miſtake me not; this diſlike or diſapproving of ſuch Acts is to be manifeſted and regulated in a due and orderly way and manner, as to, in, and by the Courts and Officers appointed thereunto, as is ſaid before: for as in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, ſo in this civil are their ſeveral Offices and Officers, as eyes, hands, head, feet, heart, and the like.)

How ſhall I, or any elſe, know any thing that comes from any, to be the will, the minde, and command of God, but as it is juſt, and right, and good? that aſſures me it is the command, the minde, and will of God; I need no more nor better proof &amp; declaration, let it come from whom, or what, or whence it will: but if it be not ſo, let it come from whom, or what, or whence it will, it is none of Gods command, minde, or will, therefore not to be obeyed by me, <hi>For it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God onely, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Nor would I be miſtaken here, as if I meant or intended, that any who will, may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the rule, power, government, or authority, upon that pretence of doing good, or having really done ſo; that is, deceitful, hath and may deceive; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as great a miſchief and inconvenience, if not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may ariſe on this hand, as on that.

will be thankful, and take it alſo as from God: yet pray I alſo do, that no incroachment may be made upon the Peoples rights, and laws; for that's not good, therefore not from God. Names and Titles have much undone us all. What are Parliaments, Kings, or Prieſts, ought or any thing, man or men elſe, but as they are juſt, and right, and good: why nothing, and to be eſteemed as nothing. What's a Temple, what's a High-prieſt, when God or good's not there? why a lye, a nothing. This is the true, infallible, everlaſting Character of God, That he is right, juſt, and good. It is admirable to ſee how names and titles blow &amp; puff us up. Parliaments, what are Parliaments? why the Councel of the people; and what is that? why the people meeting together, chuſe, from all the parts of the land, men from amongſt themſelves, of their brethren or neighbours, to meet together, (not to change or alter their laws, not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or deſtroy them, or any, or more man or men of them, in their lives, liberties, or eſtates; not to commit, do, or execute, or to command to be done, or executed any unjuſt and oppreſſive act or acts upon, or againſt any, either beſides, againſt, or contrary to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laws and cuſtomes; but) to conſult about their good, or the common good. And will or can any man think or imagine, that their councels, acts, and doings, are not to be, or may not be tryed, examined, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is greater, he that makes, or he that is made? they which chuſe, or he that is choſen? the Truſted, or the Truſtor? the Embaſſador, or the King his maſter who ordained, and made him ſuch, ſent and appointed him to his work and ſervice to his Embaſſie? It's true, he doth in all things, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118485:25"/>
fully and wholly repreſent the King his maſter, hath the ſame power and authority as his maſter hath, can, or would have, if himſelf were preſent, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his commiſſion and inſtruction, but no farther: to whom, and for the management whereof, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine accountable. And it is not, neither may, muſt, or can it be otherwiſe with Parliaments, and thoſe who chuſe them. I pray you, let us be men, and no longer children, to be frighted with the name Bugbear, with the name Parliament; but know and eſteem all things as in truth they are; keep and preſerve all things in their right places, to their right uſes and ends; giving <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to whom honor;</hi> and then we ſhall do well, like men, nay like Engliſhmen.</p>
            <p>Be not they and all others (as is ſaid before) that which they be, only and alone by and from the people, from and by their deputation, power, and commiſſion? and have they it not, or is it not in truſt onely, and that in reference to the peoples good? doubtleſs it is: then are their acts and doings, and that juſtly and rightly too, triable, and to be judged and determined by the people, concerning the juſtneſs, conſonancy to, and uprightneſs with the rule and ſtandard. Hence former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were all Acts of Parliament fairely inrolled by the clerk thereof, and ſo ſent down to the ſeveral Courts of the peoples ordinary or common Judicatories; (I may truely and rightly call them ſo) where, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, are they judged, tryed, and examined by the people: and if not found juſt and right (as before) but either beſides, contrary unto, or againſt the ſame, they ceaſe, and muſt ceaſe, ſo as no man may, or muſt, or ought obſerve and execute the ſame. Thus, I ſay (as

I have it at large in my other Treatiſe) doth and muſt all things run in a perfect round or circle, as it is in the great world; elſe would all things preſently corrupt, decay, and come to nothing, as muſt the great world it ſelf: and when, where, ſo much, and ſo far, as this orderly circular motion is not kept, maintained, and ſecured, free and clear from all ſtops, lets, hinderances, and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances; even then and there, ſo much, and ſo far, will there be, and of neceſſity muſt there be a decay, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, diſordering, and confounding of the laws, cuſtoms and conſtitutions, perſons, officers, and offices, in, appertaining, and belonging to the Commonwealth, and ſo of the Commonwealth it ſelf: as you ſee it is in the natural body of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing; yea, the whole Univerſe is onely kept, preſerved, and maintained whole, ſound, and intire, firme, ſtable, and laſting, in, by and through the due, and true, orderly, circular motion thereof; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſo the life, being, ſubſiſtence, and preſervation of the whole creation, and every particular individual thing therein, as ſhould it but once ceaſe, all things would, and muſt even ceaſe to be alſo. All perfect beings whatſoever of neceſſity muſt be thus, and thus preſerved, continued, and maintained, in this due orderly circular motion. As verily is the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, frame, rule, and government of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the great, high and deep wiſdom of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, framed and molded, as I could manifeſt unto all the world, and that in ſuch an exactneſs, as is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; all things being examined, tried, judged, corrected and amended, the ſeveral officers and offices
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118485:26"/>
ordained and appointed thereunto, in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, quiet and ſtill motion, according to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Laws, cuſtoms, and conſtitutions of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. But I muſt no further.</p>
            <p>Hence, and for this end, hath every Officer and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Commonwealth their certain, fixed pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and offices of truſt, to keep, preſerve, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the peace of the Commonwealth inviolate, by the keeping, preſerving, and maintaining the laws and conſtitutions thereof inviolate, which preſerve and keep this circular motion from all ſtops and lets, to which they are by oath more eſpecially bound and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, and ſo ought to perform the ſame accordingly, and that faithfully, perfectly, and uprightly.</p>
            <p>The Sheriffs, who are by their place and office (as is ſaid before) the keepers, protectors, and defenders of our laws and Commonwealth (and ſo each and every man therein) in peace, according to, or together with the laws, which he who breaks not, ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by it; and all and every one who do, or viſibly and apparently attempt the breach thereof, ought to be attached, ſecured, tryed, judged, and puniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto for ſo doing; he having power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or in ſuch caſe and caſes, to raiſe the power, force, and ſtrength of the County, if need be; each and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, in each and every County reſpectively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound and obliged, upon his command and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to aide and aſſiſt their reſpective Sheriffs therein alſo, with the hazard of their lives, againſt any to all who ſhall oppoſe the ſame, without diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, offices or places, even againſt the King himſelf, when the Nation had a King. This was the onely very
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118485:27"/>
true ground and cauſe of our taking up Armes at firſt; the General being but as high Sheriff of the nation, to bring thoſe who by force of arms kept themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om the judgement and execution of the Law, when they had broken and violated the ſame, the peoples liberties and freedoms therein, and ſo the common or Commonwealths peace, which every one ſo far and ſo much doth, as he violates and breaks the laws thereof. And I do confeſs that it was upon this ground, and this ground onely, that I took commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and accordingly ingaged.</p>
            <p>A little farther. You have had proved unto you, that all the Kings of England were, before their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into that office or place, ſworn duely and truely to obſerve, keep, and maintaine the Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and conſtitutions of our forefathers, the ancient fundamental Laws of this Nation, inviolate, or the laws, cuſtoms, and conſtitutions of our anceſtors, as the old records call them; (I chuſe rather to call them by the name of our <hi>fathers,</hi> &amp; that becauſe we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God to honor and obey our fathers.) They were alſo ſworn to confirm all ſuch other JUST Laws as the Commons or the people ſhould chuſe (it's all all one) but they muſt be JUST, elſe was not the King bound to confirme them, nor none elſe to keep or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, but to loath, dereſt, diſcard, caſt and throw away ſuch laws, though made by the beſt of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they be found diſſonant, againſt, or contrary unto the antient fundamental laws, principles, cuſtoms, and conſtitutions of this Commonwealth; in and by which, the very, real, and true freedome and liberty, and ſo the peace and quiet of all &amp; every one therein, is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118485:27"/>
fully, perfectly, and intirely kept, preſerved, and maintained: even as Nature doth in the natural body; that which is againſt, contrary, and deſtructive to the fundamental laws and principles thereof, it loaths, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, caſts up, and throws out, becauſe it is deſtructive to its peace and reſt, to its being, and ſo the cauſe of death. For which cauſe, that no ſuch thing or things might be made or done, to the annoyance and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the peoples peace and being, did all the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Judges in the law (as we call them) attend the Parliament, to adviſe them therein, keep and preſerve them therefrom. So that it appears, there ever was, is, and of neceſſity muſt be, a rule, meaſure, or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, by and according unto which muſt all occaſional ſtatutes or by-laws (as they are called) proces and proceedings in or by Parliaments, be exactly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made and done, as there is or ſhould be in and unto all things elſe. It becometh not wiſe men, and men in councel, to run hand over head (as we uſe to ſpeak) to do things, and make laws at hap-hazard, if they intend their obſervation and execution: it is a ſhame to ſee what Ordinances and Acts of Parliament (as they are called) have been lately publiſhed, few or none whereof will be found to hold weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>To think that Acts of Parliament muſt therefore be obſerved, and performed, and executed, becauſe they are Acts of Parliament, is moſt ridiculous; for Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments may make Acts, by which they may make ſale, give ſeiſin and poſſeſſion of the people of the land, and the land it ſelf, unto themſelves, and ſome forraign State: were this to be obſerved, done or executed,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118485:28"/>
think we, becauſe it is an Act of Parliament? The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament declared otherwiſe of King <hi>Johns</hi> Act to the Pope, when he ſold the Kingdome unto him. No; all ſuch Acts, as is before ſaid, are void and null in themſelves, be they made by Parliaments, or any other whomſoever; as every unjuſt Act and thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is, and may not be obſerved, (except to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and avoided) performed, or executed, by any whomſoever.</p>
            <p>This was the end, I ſay, of thoſe knowing and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced men in the Laws and Conſtitutions of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attending there; that ſo there might not be any cauſe or occaſion of diſorder or breach of peace, which ſuch Laws and proceedings have often occaſioned: which Rule or Standard is, and of neceſſity muſt be JUST, the juſt and true freedoms and liberties of the people, which is (undeniable by any) to be as perfectly free as God and Nature hath made them: and how free that is, I have ſhewed you before; or, as an Engliſh King ſaid, <hi>he deſired to make them and leave them as free as their owne thoughts.</hi> Or thus: that no man or men whomſoever may bear rule, have any power or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them or theirs, without their owne conſent, election, and choice; to which the laws of God, of Nature, and of this Land, agree, beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, command, ordaine, or appoint. Or thus: that nothing be done, offered, or attempted to be done, but as we would ſhould be done unto us. Would any of us that any man ſhould, without, againſt, or contrary to our owne conſent, put, impoſe, or force a Maſter over us and upon us, or if a Maſter, That any ſhould put, impoſe, or force, a Servant upon us, as aforeſaid?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118485:28"/>
would we that any man or men whomſoever ſhould take us up in the ſtreets, and carry us away, it may be from our Wives and Children, and compel us to fight, beſides, againſt, nay contrary to our minde and will? I tell you, it is a very great wickedneſs and a wickedneſs which God will ſeverely judge. So, would we that any man or men whomſoever, ſhould, without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, take away our eſtate by or under any pretence whatever, without our conſents? Every man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will certainly ſay, No: and nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the laws of <hi>England,</hi> then thus doing; nor any thing accounted a greater breach of the Peoples liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and in truth, it puts them in a worſe condition then were Villains in the times villanage. But to require ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute obedience without limitation, wereharder much, and more unreaſonable and unjuſt, then that contract tendered by <hi>Nahaſh:</hi> that they ſhould be protected by him, on condition they would put out their right eyes. He was content to leave them one to ſee withall: abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience leaves us neither, but ſtrips us quite of all, and makes us beaſts, not men: which we may not yeeld unto any, no for the ſake of any man or men whomſoever.</p>
            <p>Let us a little conſider the caſe of Villanage, as it was once in this Land. My Author hath it thus, in his 14 page; and for it he brings the Laws of <hi>Alfred, Ethelſtane, Edgar,</hi> and <hi>Canute,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt. This was the fealty ſworn unto the Lords by their Vaſſals: <hi>My Liege, I am your man, and bear you faith of life, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and terrene honour, ſaving the faith I owe to other Lords.</hi> Or thus: My Lord, I will bear you true faith, and do you true ſervice, as my duty to you is. And if our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118485:29"/>
or obedience unto Parliaments exclude us from the Law, we are in worſe eſtate then Villains: yet a Villain, who of all Vaſſals was fettered in greateſt ſervitude and bondage, moſt bound, prohibited, and reſtrained from troubling or moleſting his Lord; yet he, even he, might bring <hi>Actions of Treſpaſs,</hi> and <hi>Appeals from other Counties, Cities,</hi> or <hi>Franchiſes.</hi> And he ſaith, that <hi>Glanvil, Bracton, Britton, Fleta,</hi> with the <hi>Myrrour,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> do all agree in this, That there is in Law ſo great an obligation on the Lord, and ſo great a charge, that the Lord would often refuſe to take his Tenants homage; ſo that there was a Writ made commanding him to take it, and by it to oblige himſelf to his tenant, whom he was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: and his Treſpaſs on him had in Law, had a very great aggravation, becauſe the Vaſſal was to be under the defence and protection of his Liege or Lord: and that in divers caſes Vaſſals might defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Lord, as for atturning and aſſigning his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals ſervice (which the Law permitted them to do) to his enemy or foe, for that was againſt the Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as in divers other caſes, the Lord might forfeit his Vaſſals homage and ſervice; for his right might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, eſcheat, or evict by Law; and dominion over ſlaves was alſo loſt, by negligence, violence, <hi>&amp; per injuſtam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtantiam,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> expreſſeth it: nay, there may be ſuch <hi>delict</hi> in the Lord, as may not onely warrant, but enforce the vaſſal to complain and accuſe his Lord, or cauſe him to be indited for his life in the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which the King himſelf can no more ſhut againſt the meaneſt ſubject, then he can the doors of all the Churches: (They are <hi>Fleta</hi>'s own words, ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and that he might go higher then a Church of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118485:29"/>
clay.) His meaning therein is left to be conſidered by others, and is ſo by me alſo. He goes further, and tells us, that <hi>there be ſome caſes in which a vaſſal may not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite his Lord for his life, but may appeal him, and fight againſt him in combat, or wage battel with him.</hi> In his 18 page he tells us, that <hi>as the vaſſal might do nothing againſt his Lord, to diſ-inherit him,</hi> vel ad aliam arrocem injuriam, <hi>or do any other wickedneſs or injury unto him; ſo muſt not the Lord againſt the vaſſal: for if he do,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the homage is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and all obligation.</hi> So that, as my Author ſaith in his 19 page, we ſee this Oath of fealty to be ſo limited by Law, that it bindeth no more then Law requireth; and that the ſame Law doth ſet a Vaſſal, nay a Villain, free from, and arm him againſt his own Lord, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of himſelf and the Laws, with the Publike good. He goes on, and tells us, from his fore-cited Authors, how that all Allegiance, Oaths of Fealty, and ſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, obſervance, duty, and ſubjection unto all, even the higheſt and greateſt of all, is in reference to Juſtice, to the common good and profit of the Land, <hi>per honeſtum &amp; utile,</hi> for publike peace, and common juſtice. Allegiance, ſaith he, was <hi>ad Legem,</hi> to the Laws, the Kingdom, and the Kingdoms good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And verily, no more, or no otherwiſe, may any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it from any. And if Parliaments expect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it otherwiſe, it were much better for all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that they were Slaves, Vaſſals, and Villains, as thoſe of old: in which caſes, as ſaith my Author in his 24 page, they debate who ſhould be Judge: And for this, they all agree in that Fundamental Principle of Right Reaſon and Nature, That Parties may never be Judges in their own Cauſes; for which, beſides all others, the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118485:30"/>
               <hi>Myrrour</hi> is large and clear, among all exceptions to the Judges perſon (if he have no Commiſſion, or refuſe to ſhew it, as he ought, or be party, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> of which alſo <hi>Britton</hi> in Appeals, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>fol.</hi> 41. So that you ſee plain, Parliaments may not be Judges in their own Cauſe, of their own Acts and doings. But who then? Why the People; firſt, in, by, and amongſt themſelves; and then, in and by their ſeveral Courts, Offices, and Officers, ordained and appointed thereunto. God himſelf ever hath, doth, and ever will do, ſubmit his Commands, his Ways, his Acts, Doings, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in reference to the ſons of men, to be examined, tryed, and judged by the ſons of men, as you will finde it thorowout the Scriptures. The God of <hi>England,</hi> nay the God of all the world, will be juſt, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is juſt, and that unto the leaſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame unto the judgement of the leaſt, even thoſe who are his creatures; and ſhall any man or men in <hi>England</hi> refuſe to ſubmit their Commands, their Acts and Deeds, unto the judgement of thoſe who are their Superiours, who made, created, and entruſted them? Sure it may not, nor it muſt not be. Why ſhould we ſo forget our Maker?</p>
            <p>For which cauſe and cauſes, we may not, we muſt not, we ought not, nay, we dare not know any perſon or perſons, thing or things, whomſoever or whatſoever, that may or ſhall be otherwiſe ordained, appointed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, or commanded, ſo as to yeeld any obedience thereunto; nor may we, nor muſt we, nor ought we, nor dare we to fall down and worſhip any man or men, or any of the Idol-inventions of any man or men whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; we may onely know and do the Commands of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118485:30"/>
our God, and the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances of our fore-fathers. We will not go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> into <hi>the houſe of bondage,</hi> from which the Lord our God hath ſet and kept us free: We will not (for we may not, being all and every one of us Nazarites unto the Lord) ſuffer our ſeven locks to be ſhaved off our heads by any <hi>Dalilah</hi> whatſoever, leſt we be taken by the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and by them have both our eyes put out; and ſo be led (as then it is very eaſie to be done) and bound in fetters, to grind in the priſon-houſe. We have kept and preſerved them hitherto; we have defended and maintained our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt Kings and Parliaments, with the hazard of our lives, the expence of our eſtates, and blood alſo. Thoſe who have loſt their locks, let them grinde in the Priſon-houſe, if it muſt be ſo, until they be grown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but we wiſh it may or might be otherwiſe, and pray it may ſo be. We for our parts neither may, muſt, can, nor will (the Lord our God helping and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of us) give a falſe, unjuſt, untrue, unwarrantable, illegal value and eſtimate either of perſons or of things, becauſe we know perfectly, and fully underſtand, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, That in a juſt weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is and doth conſiſt the very life and being of all things. We have the Law of our God ſo written and ingraven in our hearts, that we cannot do otherwiſe: we do in good earneſt <hi>love our neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> and we do truely <hi>honour our Fathers;</hi> and we muſt, and are commanded by the Lord our God ſo to do, <hi>that the days may be long in the land which the Lord our God giveth us:</hi> it is the onely Command with promiſe. And we know this will, and that nothing elſe, without this, can give us the enjoyment thereof, in peace and reſt (as we could
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118485:31"/>
demonſtrate to all the world) and we do, or at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour to <hi>worſhip the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our minde, with all our ſoul, and with all our ſtrength,</hi> and to ſerve him all our days, and him onely, even him <hi>who brought us out of the land of Egypt, and houſe of bondage.</hi> And for this cauſe, or for theſe reaſons, is the Command and Oath of our Fathers, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Oath of our God, upon us; who never did, nor can, nor will command or require any thing but that which is juſt and right, true and good for us: yea, our own Oath manifold is upon us; and we do know why, for what cauſe, and to what end we entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into: And we fear an Oath, and it may not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be revoked for ever; for it is juſt and right, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true. We muſt and will (God aſſiſting) walk within our due and true bounds and limits, ſet, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and appointed unto us by the Lord our God, and by our fore-fathers, in their Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions; and in them (for that we certainly know, in the breaking of them, we break and undo our ſelves) and in them onely, we do and can indeed walk ſafely and ſecurely, in peace, tranquillity, and reſt of body and minde. They are our ſtrong Tower, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Caſtle and Fortreſs, out of which we cannot be beaten, and in which, we do not fear any or all the things in heaven and earth. Herein is, herein will and ſhall be the joy and delight of our eyes, yea, and of our ſouls alſo, and that all our days, even in the commands of our God, the Laws, Ordinances, Cuſtoms, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of our fore-fathers, in which we will ever and always walk, live, and continue. Our father <hi>David</hi> did ſo; our fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> did ſo; and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118485:31"/>
from them we may not part, nor depart; we may not leave them nor forſake them, leſt we die; nor turn either to the right hand or to the left, to do either more or leſs then according thereunto: but in all things, in all times, towards our ſelves and all men, ſo much and ſo far as we are able, will we walk perfectly upright, like men, like our ſelves, as we are in or after the image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
            <p>And, from henceforth, let no man accuſe, charge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or condemn us, for diſorderly, ſtubborn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, gainſaying, backſliding, or rebellious children to God or our Fathers, for haters, deſpiſers, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of our Neighbours, for deceitful, unkinde, or unmerciful, for enemies, traytors, or rebels: for verily, as you ſee, we are obedient, orderly, true, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, truſty, faithful, loving, reſpectful worſhippers, honourers, obſervers, doers, and performers of the Commands of our God, and of our Fathers; and hearty real lovers of our Neighbour: earneſtly praying, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and uprightly deſiring and endeavouring their good, even as our own.</p>
            <p>I have, in a very ſcattered confuſed manner (which I pray excuſe) ſhewed you, in ſome meaſure, the footſteps of our Forefathers, in part, and but in part; the way and path, <hi>the good old way,</hi> in which our Fathers walked, and had peace. That which hath enlarged it ſo much beyond my firſt intentions, is the Reaſon ſhewn, Grounds given, and Foundation layd, for men to ſee by and ſtand upon; my other Treatiſe carrying much more in the womb of it, if it be well weighed and conſidered: in and by which, my deſire was chiefly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118485:32"/>
to give a ſtop to the extravagancies, exorbitancies, and exceſſes of our preſent times, unto thoſe haſtie, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, violent, hot, and too too eager motions gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poſſeſſing, and very greatly injuring moſt mens mindes; which hath and doth cauſe many diſorders and diſtempers in and amongſt us all; moſt men much over-ſhooting or over-running themſelves, their own deſires and endeavours, their own peace, aims and ends; as it is written, <hi>Whilſt ſeeking freedom, and ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free, they indeed become ſervants and ſlaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That golden apple of Unlimitedneſs, which Kings and Armies, yea Parliaments alſo, are ſo much taken with, and ſtill deſirous of; that Witch, that beautious taking Witch, which ſtripes and ſtrips, beats, bends and bows, diſrobes, makes naked, and unthrones us all. I ſay, My deſire therein was, to give a ſtop and ſtand unto theſe haſtie, hurrying, ſlippery times; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we are; and where we are; from what, from whence, or from whom we came: that ſo, like the Prodigal, we may bethink our ſelves of our Fathers houſe; and ſo begin to make our returns thither. And if we finde our ſelves not Prodigals, feeding upon husks with the ſwine, I am very much miſtaken. And if it be not our work, our onely work, to return to him from whom and whence we came, even to our fathers houſe, my eyes extremely fail me; for which you ſhall finde at large in that Treatiſe: I could heartily wiſh it might be well looked into, and ſeriouſly conſidered of; it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more in it then may perhaps at firſt be diſcerned: May end and way alſo (I hope) therein is peace, peace unto all, reconciliation with all, and a perfect uniting of us all. I have in this ſpoken ſomething more plainly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118485:32"/>
and particularly, as to the way and means in reference unto ſome things, as alſo to our continuance and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment therein. If it do appear and be found ſo, I will hope all Engliſh-men (for unto all I ſpeak, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to ſpeak, without exception) will begin not onely to look towards it, but to walk in it.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewed you, that Juſtneſs, Rightneſs, or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and it onely, is, and that it certainly is, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life and being of all things; and that without it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſſibly can be or exiſt: that in and by the true knowledge of things, we ſhall be able to give a true, juſt, and right eſtimate and valuation of things; which being done and continued, will keep a right, juſt, and true order, and ſo a conſtant and ſetled peace; which otherwiſe cannot poſſibly be.</p>
            <p>I do profeſs my ſelf enemy to no man or men, thing or things whomſoever or whatſoever; nor envie I any; nor verily know I any cauſe why: for I know not any that is or can be enemy unto me, envie, hate, or hurt me; for certainly there is nothing contrary unto me, though many both men and things much differing from me: all the enmities, hatreds, ſtrifes &amp; contentions, which are or poſſibly can be, ariſing onely (as I have already ſhewed) from thoſe exceſſes or exorbitancies, from that intenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the minde, or violent, impetuous, eager opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, &amp; reſtleſs workings of the ſpirit in men or things for or after maſtery or predominancie, (and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great miſtake, which I may not ſpeak to now) of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or bearing the rule or ſway; which when Wiſdom enters, that ceaſes. This is ſo plain and clear, as I know nothing more; and yet we ſee it not, (it is our haſte.)</p>

as in Fire and Water, the one hot and dry, the other cold and moiſt; the one feminine, the other maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine; or (I had rather ſay) the one <hi>more</hi> hot and dry, and ſo <hi>more</hi> maſculine; the other <hi>more</hi> cold and moiſt, and ſo <hi>more</hi> feminine: for they are in and with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, confiſt and ſubſiſt by each other, and cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be without each other: yet (I ſay) we ſee, theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries (ſo colled) readily joyn and unite, embrance, and kiſs each other, when and where this intenſeneſs ceaſes. Yet a little further: where this intenſeneſs or violent working of the ſpirit in any man or thing is, though it be in the ſelf-ſame things, there appears the ſame, if not much greater enmity then in thoſe we cal contraries: we ſee it thus un things of one &amp; the very ſelf-ſame nature, temper, and conſtitution; as in men and beaſts, and all things elſe, when the ſpirit of them is excited, ſtirred up, and moved, as before. So that hence onely comes the enmity (let it be conſidered.) It is enough, (&amp; I hope not too much.) Hence it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> and that which hath enough within it ſelf, in reference to it ſelf, cares but little for any more. In weight and meaſure, in time and ſeaſon, is all things; which who knows, but he that is in them? It is enough, and it is for <hi>England</hi>'s ſake, that I have written what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; (to me either this or that, any thing or nothing, it matters not) for your ſakes, whoſe peace and happineſs (without reſpect of perſons) is heartily deſired by</p>

            <head>Since my writing hereof, I met with a Book intituled <hi>The firſt Addreſſes to his Excellencie the Lond General, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>John Spittlehouſe,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BY which I perceive, the Gentleman hath taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a Book I lately publiſhed, and called <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Centre and Foundation of Peace and Rest;</hi> and that he is at ſome things therein offended. In his 18 page to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the later end, he hath theſe words: <hi>And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, according to Captain</hi> Norwood'<hi>s rule, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> contrary to his opinion, in that he claimeth the aforeſaid L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">

                  </gap> of corrupt Reaſon as his Fathers patrimony; and there ſetteth an invaluable eſteem upon them in his late Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 19 page, he tells them, that they <hi>are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> duty and ſervice to propagate the Laws he offers, and to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate the other, which Captain</hi> Norwood <hi>would ſo gladly have preſerved, bidding defiance even unto God himſelf to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, in a moſt impious manner; whereas there is not one text of Scripture that giveth liberty either to adde or diminiſh from the aforeſaid Laws, or any wiſe to alter them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will in this thing, and onely in this thing, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this once, ſhew the Gentleman the fruits of his raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>He tells you, that <hi>What he propoſes, may not be altered; none may adde ought to it, or take ought from it; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>they were given by God.</hi> We will not blot too much paper, nor run after butterflyes; that's ſport for boys, and not work for men: there is too much of it every day. But in brief, thus:</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>God is his Father;</hi> and I do believe him to be mine alſo. And then he ſaith, that <hi>every believer is of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118485:34"/>
Abrahams ſeed.</hi> Then muſt <hi>Abraham</hi> needs be every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers father: wherefore, until he do prove me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, and childe of the devil, what I have written ſtands, &amp; muſt ſtand, to be confirmed by all who come after, unalterable and unchangeable by any Kings or Parliaments, yea or by God himſelf. He may not then blame me for laying claim to, and ſetting ſo high an eſteem of their Laws, but blame himſelf for thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding himſelf, &amp; calling the Laws of God my Father the Laws of Corrupt Reaſon. Conſider by what you have ſeen and heard, from whom or from whence I came or did proceed. Underſtand you this ſame thing, ponder on it a little: it is written, <hi>An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</hi> nor can a corrupt or pudled foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſend forth pure, clean, and uncorrupted ſtreams.</p>
            <p>This were enough for anſwer; but I will give you a little more. Is there the leaſt ſimilitude of ſuch a thing therein, as my laying claim to Corrupt Laws, or the Laws of Corrupt Reaſon? Can you poſſibly collect ſuch a Premiſe from which you can tenter and ſtrain ſuch a Concluſion? Say I not, that <hi>very few of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute laws or By laws, but are diſagreeing and contrary to our fore-fathers Laws, and are therefore null in themſelves, and not to be executed?</hi> It was too haſtie and inconſiderate a charge. Or do I, as you ſay, <hi>Defie God?</hi> You are apt to miſtakes. I call on him to juſtifie, bear witneſs, and give teſtimony to or of his own Commands, as the <hi>Rechabites</hi> did: he hath commanded us to <hi>honour and obey our fathers;</hi> and he doth often prove his children, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will be obedient, and ſtand faſt in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as he did the <hi>Rechabites</hi> and others: and ſuch who have and ſhall ſtand faſt, and continue to the end,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118485:34"/>
ſhall certainly have the Crown, bear and wear the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Can God change or deny himſelf? No, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; and if he ſhould, by Prophet, by Dream, Voice or Viſion, give a contrary Command, I will ſtill ſay I will not believe it, nor do it: for what in it ſelf, in its own nature, eſſence, and being, is juſt, right, and true, is ever and always ſo; is as God himſelf is, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſo to all eternity. It is too much; but I have done it for your ſake. Yet a little further.</p>
            <p>What if the Laws I call for prove to be the moſt juſt, the moſt righteous, the moſt equitable, and the moſt merciful in the whole world? who then (think you) will be found the Father of them? I have and do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and aver them ſo to be; and that my aſſertion and averment muſt ſtand, with you and all men, until your ſelf, or ſome other, prove them otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I give your friend alſo this counſel, that he well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he doth, and that he make not too much haſte, left he repent himſelf likewiſe; for aſſuredly you know not either from what, to what, nor yet by what mean you go or move, or at leaſt would go and move; which it becomes every wiſe man to know, before he begin his motion. Were not the Jews corrupt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme corrupt, above any people under heaven? as the Scriptures reſtifie. Were therefore the Laws of their fore-fathers ſo? And if any had in thoſe corrupt times called for their fore-fathers Laws, would it have been ſaid he called for <hi>corrupt laws,</hi> or <hi>the laws of corrupt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> It is enough.</p>
            <p>Do I call mine <hi>The centre and foundation of Englands peace and reſt?</hi> And is it not ſo? Verily it is, and muſt and will be found and made ſo, if ever <hi>England</hi> come
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118485:35"/>
to be ſetled in peace and reſt. Therefore I ſay again unto all and every one, Look well upon it, and into it; and what I have written, I have written.</p>
            <p>By the way, know, that the puniſhment of Theft by death, with many other of the like nature, are none of our forefathers Laws; <hi>it was not ſo in the beginning,</hi> as I could prove, but introduced by another hand &amp; way, as I could ſhew alſo; &amp; no more to be eſteemed ours, then the Idolatry of the Iſraelites, ſet up, countenanced, and maintained by a Law, could be ſaid to be the Law of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> nor the oppreſſions and injuſtice done and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongſt us, be any more attributed to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Laws, then the putting to death of <hi>Naboth,</hi> &amp; other wickedneſſes and oppreſſions done and committed by their Kings and Rulers could be attributed to their Laws. And ſo (my good friend)</p>
